Provide the bucket name:

Must be globally unique within the partition (e.g., aws, aws-cn)

3–63 characters, only lowercase letters, numbers, periods (.), and hyphens (-)

Begin and end with a letter or number

Best to avoid periods unless necessary (e.g., static website use)

Default: Bucket owner enforced (ACLs disabled; bucket owner owns all objects)

Alternatives allow object uploader ownership or uploaders must grant control via ACL

Set Block Public Access options. By default all settings are enabled—recommended for most cases to prevent unintended public exposure.

(Optional) Configure Default Encryption:

Choices: SSE‑S3 (Amazon-managed keys), SSE‑KMS (KMS‑managed), DSSE‑KMS (dual-layer)

If using KMS, be mindful of request‑per‑second quotas and use S3 Bucket Keys to reduce costs.

(Optional) Enable Object Lock for WORM (write-once-read-many) object retention—automatically enables versioning.
