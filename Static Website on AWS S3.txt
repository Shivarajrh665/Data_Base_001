[How to Host a Static Website on AWS S3 Bucket | Step‑by‑Step Practical Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRtgOhYulM&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Here’s a great YouTube tutorial that walks you through the process of hosting a static website using Amazon S3—from bucket creation to configuring public access and testing the live site.

### Step‑by‑Step Guide to Host a Static Website on AWS S3

#### 1. Create S3 Bucket

* Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 service.
* Click **Create Bucket**, specify a **globally unique bucket name** and select a **region** near your users.
  Ensure the name adheres to DNS naming conventions.([AWS Documentation][1], [codeair.in][2])

#### 2. Upload Website Files

* Open your bucket and go to the **Objects** (or **Overview**) tab.
* Click **Upload** → **Add files** (HTML, CSS, JS, images like `index.html`).
* Upload all necessary files.([AWS Documentation][3], [Medium][4], [codeair.in][2])

#### 3. Enable Static Website Hosting

* Go to the **Properties** tab of the bucket.
* Under **Static website hosting**, click **Edit** → choose **Enable** → select **Host a static website**.
* Enter your **Index document** (e.g., `index.html`) and optionally an **Error document** (e.g., `error.html`).
* Save changes and note the **website endpoint URL** (e.g., `http://<bucket-name>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com`). ([AWS Documentation][5], [codeair.in][2])

#### 4. Allow Public Read Access

##### Option A — Bucket Policy (Recommended)

* Go to the **Permissions** tab → **Block public access** → click **Edit** → uncheck **Block all public access** and confirm.([AWS Documentation][6])
* Under **Bucket Policy**, add a policy like:

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }]
  }
  ```

  Replace `your-bucket-name` accordingly.([AWS Documentation][6], [Medium][4], [codeair.in][2], [swathireddy.hashnode.dev][7])

##### Option B — Object ACLs (Less preferred)

* Select your files → use **Actions → Make public** to grant public-read ACL at file level.([Medium][8])

#### 5. Test Your Website

* Visit the website endpoint provided in the **Properties** panel (HTTP only).
* You should see your `index.html` rendered.([Medium][4], [codeair.in][2], [swathireddy.hashnode.dev][7])

#### 6. (Optional) Add Custom Domain with HTTPS via CloudFront

* Static S3 hosting only supports HTTP. To serve site over HTTPS:

  * Set up a **CloudFront distribution** with your S3 bucket as the origin.
  * Use **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** to generate an SSL certificate.
  * In Route 53 (or your DNS provider), create an **Alias (A) record** pointing to your CloudFront distribution.([zignuts.com][9], [FreeCodeCamp][10], [WIRED][11], [Cloud Computing and DevOps][12])

Reditt users also strongly recommend using CloudFront:

> “Nowadays, no one should be using S3 for website hosting without CloudFront” —([Reddit][13])
> “You cannot access a S3 bucket with a custom domain name with HTTPS… solution is to create a CloudFront CDN…” —([Reddit][14])

| Step | Task                                                               |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Create S3 bucket (unique name, region)                             |
| 2    | Upload static site files (HTML, CSS, JS)                           |
| 3    | Enable static website hosting (index/error docs)                   |
| 4    | Set public read access via bucket policy or ACL                    |
| 5    | Access site via S3 website endpoint                                |
| 6    | (Optional) Setup CloudFront + Route 53 for HTTPS and custom domain |

### Best Practices

* **Use HTTPS** in the modern web—front your S3 site with CloudFront and ACM.
* **Keep private data secure**—only public content should be exposed.
* **Enable versioning** on the bucket for easy content rollback if needed.
* Use **CloudFront caching and SSL** for performance, security, and lower costs.([zignuts.com][9], [AWS Documentation][1], [Reddit][13])
